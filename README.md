# Manage who can create Microsoft 365 Groups

This is a simplified and more understandable version of the script Microsoft provides at <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/manage-creation-of-groups?view=o365-worldwide#step-2-run-powershell-commands>.

## To do

Configure parameters, especially the variable $allowedGroupName in the parameters section.
If Azure AD Preview is installed already, put a comment pragma (#) in front of the ````Install-Module```` line.
